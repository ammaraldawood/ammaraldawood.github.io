    "text": "It was June of 2022 when I first decided to delve (back) into mathematics and computation. This was induced by the fact that biology has been turning into a computational field of sorts due to the advent of high throughput sequencing and advanced simulation capabilities. Biology provides a wealth of information unlike any other, and statistical methods applied through computation and code are shaping up to be the future of the entire field\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{aldawood2025,\n  author = {Aldawood, Ammar},\n  title = {Why {AI} {Didn’t} {Stop} {Me} {From} {Learning} to {Code}},\n  date = {2025-08-08},\n  url = {https://ammaraldawood.com/blog/posts/2025-08-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAldawood, Ammar. 2025. “Why AI Didn’t Stop Me From Learning to\nCode.” August 8, 2025. https://ammaraldawood.com/blog/posts/2025-08-05."
