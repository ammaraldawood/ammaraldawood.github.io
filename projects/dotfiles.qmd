## Technology Stack

* **Programming Languages:**
  * **Lua:** Neovim configuration language.
  * **Shell:** Zsh scripts and terminal customization.

<br>

* **Core Technologies:**
  * **Neovim:** Text editor centered around Vim Motions.
  * **Tmux:** Terminal multiplexer and sessionizer
  * **Ghostty:** Terminal emulator with shader support.
  * **Git:** Version control.
  * **Homebrew:** Package management.

## Project Learnings/Skills

1.  **Software Architecture:** Managing the interplay of different programs and
their respective plugins and themes, resolving conflicts and optimizing user
experience. For example, installing bioSyntax which is available for Vim and
making it available to Neovim through a Lua function call.

2.  **Shell Scripting:** Creating aliases and custom shell functions that
perform repetitive tasks and multi-step operations using a single-word command.
For example, 'cld' which concatenates the contents of the latest downloaded
file using bat.

3.  **Command Line Fluency:** Introduced to countless terms and paradigms that
I had to look up while working on this setup, some of which I might not have
run into otherwise, including fuzzy search, inodes, size vs blocksize,
symlinks, ripgrep, glob operators, globbing flags, aliasing, regex, environment
variables and makefiles, amongst others.
