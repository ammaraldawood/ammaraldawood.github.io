## Technology Stack

* **Programming Languages:**
  * **Swift:** Used for the entirety of the project

<br>

* **Core Technologies:**
  * **SwiftUI:** Building the user interface of the app
  * **Swift Charts:** Used to create a pie chart to simulate infection and a scrollable chart to show the history of infection
  * **Xcode:** The main IDE used to build the project
  * **Adobe Illustrator:** Used to create the logo, thumbnail and the mascot (Dominic)
  * **SF Symbols:** Used to create the icons used inside the SimulationView

## Project Learnings/Skills

1.  **Software Architecture:** Managing the interplay of different files,
the environment and observable attributes, and handling persistence of values.

2.  **Charting:** Creating both a live and a scrollable chart using Swift
Charts.

3.  **Graphic Design:** Created the logo, thumbnail, icons and others using
software external to Xcode like Adobe Illustrator and SF Symbols.

4. **Practical Practice:** This happens to be my first coding project of any
kind, and so it represents the first time I went out of 'tutorial hell' into
'learning by doing'

## Project Pitfalls

1. **Scarcity of Training and Time:** The project was created within 6 months
of me first beginning to learn how to program and code, and it was started on the
20th of January of 2023 and finished by the 26th of February of 2023, meaning
the code, art and ideation all happened in a period of five weeks. In hindsight,
the project is riddled with issues.

2. **Disregard for UNIX Philosophy & SOLID principles:** The project contains
a class object named sharedClass, which resembles what is known as a God Object
in OOP programming, an object that handles and sees everything. The
Observable macro was released in WWDC 2022 alongside pie charts and phase
animators, and by trying to incorporate all three into my project, I ended up
working with things I didn't understand and which had no fixes online for when
troubles came up.

3. **Poor Ideation:** The very idea behind the app is kind of useless and non
impactful. For this contest specifically, Apple seeks out project ideas that
are most likely to change people's lives. Some ideas used in previous years
didn't achieve that particularly, but the projects were written so much better
than mine.

4. **Lack of Testing:** Having been so low on time working on the project, I hadn't
shown it to anyone prior to submitting it to Apple. During the next couple of
days, I went to a cafe with a friend whom I asked to try and use the app. He
had a hard time understanding what the app was trying to achieve, how he should
act/react to its components, and finally ended up crashing it by 'using' an
antibiotic too much, which lead to a number of bacteria skyrocketing high enough
that the variable used to store them crashed the app. This was because I used
the Gompertz model of bacterial growth which wasn't log transformed or handled
well to prevent exponential increases in counts.
