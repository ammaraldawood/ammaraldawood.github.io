## Technology Stack

* **Programming Languages:**
  * **Python:** CO2 emissions data analysis.
  * **SQL:** Understanding the bicycle market and the store's stock.

<br>

* **Core Technologies:**
  * **DataLab:** DataCamp's online editor similar to Juptyer Notebooks.

## Project Learnings/Skills

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Finding patterns and pecularities within the
provided datasets to make correlations and investigate relationships.

2.  **Data Visualization:** Creating multi-faceted plots and deducing
relationships from visualizations as opposed to merely visualizing established
correlations.

3.  **Domain Knowledge:** Using knowledge of car manufacturing and design to
make correlations to the observed data and visualizations.

4. **Python & SQL:** This project was the way I learned both Python and SQL by
doing. Prior to it, I had only taken the available free courses provided
through DataCamp (Introduction to Python and Introduction to SQL), which don't
even cover functions, classes and whatnot. By the point I had started working
on it, all my programming knowledge was strictly based on Swift syntax and
definitions. Later on, I subscribed to DataCamp and began learning R, Python
and SQL, alongside statistics and machine learning.

## Project Pitfalls

1. **Lack of Novelty:** Not including AI and sophisticated Python libraries or
SQL visualizations made the project suffer during the first phase of community
voting, which probably means it never got to be judged by the DataCamp staff.
Being minimally sufficient, similar to the way linear regression is sometimes 
the best tool to use in machine learning tasks as opposed to neural networks,
was a disadvantage given that the goal was not to accomplish the given task,
but rather to wow the voting community.

2. **Missed Visualization Best Practices:** Using a form of jitter for
overlapping points and varying the libraries used for visualization might have
had more desired outcomes.
