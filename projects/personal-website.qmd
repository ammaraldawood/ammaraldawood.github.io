## Project Learnings/Skills

1.  **Programmatic Visualization:** All original diagrams and visualizations 
for this website and blog posts were generated programmatically (e.g., using
Python/R libraries) rather than using standard graphic design tools as a
self-imposed technical constraint.

2.  **Technical Writing Skills:** Proficiency in creating and deploying
code-integrated documentation. Focus on clear narrative flow and
attention-grabbing storytelling.

3.  **Project Management:** Planning the overall structure of the website to
suit my specific needs, avoid overlap and regurgitation between website 
sections and create an easily navigable experience for the visitor.
