## Taking the First Step

It was June of 2022 when I first decided to delve into mathematics and 
computation at 22 years of age. 

I began my learning journey with the programming language Swift, which is 
mainly used to develop for Apple platforms. Quite an unintuitive choice given
that Python and R are the languages most used for computational biology, which
is the field I'm interested in, but I thought that Swift Playgrounds, an app
designed by Apple to teach people how to code, looked like a great interactive
tool that would make programming concepts stick. Not too long after, I signed
up for Angela Yu's Udemy course to learn Swift app development.

As a medical laboratory scientist whose research will mostly involve large
amounts of biological data that needs to be analyzed in all sorts of ways, I
was left with very little room to keep dodging this undertaking, especially
since it was my intention from the beginning to become a researcher, as
opposed to a clinical lab technician doing routine work.

## Emerging Fields

This was induced by the fact that biology and medicine have been turning into
computational fields of sorts due to the advent of high throughput sequencing
and advanced simulation capabilities which made it even thinkable to
statistically model biological systems [^1].

[^1]: There are numerous papers that talk about this, here are some of them: 
[All Biology is Computational Biology](
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050
){target="_blank"},
[Mathematics Is Biology's Next Microscope, Only Better;
Biology Is Mathematics' Next Physics, Only Better](
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020439
){target="_blank"}

A prime example of this is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a Markov chain
Monte Carlo method, which made computational Bayesian inference tractable by
enabling sampling from complex posterior distributions.

Biology provides a wealth of high-dimensional information unlike any other of
the natural sciences while medicine benefits from having room to make many 
trials and errors before applying on the living. Statistical methods applied
through computation and code are shaping up to be the future of those fields,
more so than they already are.

## A Dilemma and a Dichotomy

A couple of months after I began, in November of 2022, the service ChatGPT was
launched, and managed to become the fastest-growing consumer application in
history, with nearly all of the news outlets claiming how impactful it could 
be as a technological advancement, which I happened to agree with. Conversely,
many people touted it as the beginning of a great replacement of humans or 
their jobs at least, with specialties involving lots of text, including code,
being at the forefront.

So there I was, the guy who spent the last 6 months learning to code, being
told that I wasted my time doing so. But did I? I had no way of knowing,
especially since I had yet to utilize my newly-attained knowledge and skills.
This made me undecided on whether I should halt my learning-to-code journey,
at least until things became more lucid. However, **I didn't have to wait**. 

In this post, I will lay out the reasoning as to why I thought it was a good 
idea for me to keep going forward no matter what else was going on in the 
world, and why this opinion was backed by a dichotomy of possible futures, the 
cheerful and the pessimistic, making me even more resolute in my decision.

## Bright Times Ahead

#### Exponential Growth

At least some people will argue, including most if not all of the CEOs of the 
companies heavily invested in AI, that machine learning 
will be as revolutionary as the computer and internet, with Google's CEO 
Sundar Pichai even claiming it is 'more profound than fire and electricity'!
[^2]
If that is to be true, then we as humans have quite undermined how much 
computation as a concept is ingrained into existence.

Fire, Electricity - Bloomberg Television](

Think about it, mathematics and logic are both considered formal sciences, with
the difference being from the natural sciences is that formal sciences are a
priori, focusing more on abstraction and deductive reasoning, whereas natural
sciences are a posteriori, focusing more on application and inductive 
reasoning. I assume that if you ask most people to provide a heuristic, mental
model of how these sciences are layered, they would give you something like 
the following: 

```{mermaid}
%%{init: {'themeVariables': {'textColor': '#ffffff'}}}%%

end

end

end

end
rect rgb(255, 255, 255)
Engineering->>Physics: Engineering arises from and affects<br/>our understanding of the central sciences and<br/>the rest of the applied sciences
end
rect rgb(255, 255, 255)
Chemistry->>Logic: The central sciences act as a checker for the<br/>findings of the applied sciences and depend on<br/>maths and logic to verify empirical findings
end
```

Math and logic at the fundamental level, on top of it lies physics which 
argues from first principles and chemistry which is a complication of physics, 
and with the rest of the natural sciences and computation layered on top of it 
as being dependent on physical interactions. This is a mostly accurate mental 
model, but what it fails to convey is the categorization of computer science 
as a formal science alongside mathematics and logic, and how central it could 
be as a tool, albeit a more applicative one than abstract, to understanding 
all of existence, just like mathematics and logic are. 

This could mean, at least in theory, that most humans doing any kind of 
intellectual work in the future, will have to have some understanding of 
computational concepts to arrive at certain desired conclusions. In contrast, 
compare the previous mental model to the following one:

```{mermaid}

end
rect rgb(255, 255, 255)

end
rect rgb(255, 255, 255)

end
rect rgb(255, 255, 255)
Engineering->>Logic: The empirical sciences relay feedback to their<br/>constituents, including other empirical and all of<br/>the formal sciences.
end
```

:::

You'll notice that both models provide a somewhat reasonable feedback network
between the different fields of knowledge. What the latter model achieves 
better though is highlighting how computer science sits a level below and not 
on the same level as the empirical sciences. This makes it less of an adjacent 
field and more of a constituent of other fields. Yes, a huge side of it is
applied and empirical, but its essence is theoretical.

Assuming that machine learning does in fact become as influential and
revolutionary as some claim it to be, then it would position those who
are capable of directly influencing it as the pioneers of fields where it ends
up being utilized.

#### A Mutual Language

As it stands, machine learning models suffer from a plethora of problems 
related to how they learn, what data they're trained on and how complex is 
the feedback mechanism for the model. These problems include but are not 
limited to bias, hallucinations, model/mode collapse and catastrophic 
interference.

Most of these errors can only be sufficiently addressed by tuning the model 
itself, as opposed to communicating linguistically with the chat agent hoping 
that modifying words would garner better results in what is known as prompt 
engineering. To achieve this, one has to be knowledgeable with the 
inner workings of the model, including the maths and computation behind it. 

This is similar to two doctors, one who tells you that you have an infection 
because he placed their hands on your forehead and concluded so from your 
fever, and another who reads the results of your complete blood count to 
realize you had elevated eosinophil levels which reduces the possibilities 
for the cause of fever to either allergy or parasitic infections. Which 
doctor would you trust to address your problem? This mirrors the limitations of 
prompt engineering versus direct model tuning. Looking at the code or math
behind the model is equivalent to having a blood test of a patient.

#### Irreducible Complexity

Given that one day we might end up with a highly intelligent machine learning
agent, be it artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial super
intelligence (ASI), the fact still remains that no matter how intelligent it
is, it will still be limited both by compute and algorithms, just like we are
limited by our memories and attention spans. 

When thinking about visiting other stars and galaxies, often the first thing to come to mind is our lack
of a near-speed-of-light vehicle as a means of transportation to be able to
get us there in a lifetime. What is equally important is how our biology
will handle such speeds, which in my opinion will prove to future generations
a bigger hurdle than creating spaceships that travel as fast as needed. Also
important is how spacetime will prohibit meaningful communication of findings
after each space trip, since time dilation dictates the galactic traveler will
return to a world thousands of years older than it were when their decade-long
trip had begun. Similarly, AI's intelligence is and will most likely remain
bounded by compute and algorithms, much like our biology limits cosmic 
exploration.

For artificial intelligence, especially natural language processing models, the
crux of the argument is no longer whether they could be prevented from creating
nonsensical ideas, but whether their **algorithmic complexity** can 
successfully utilize reduced non-linguistic ideas like three-dimensional 
structures,  networks...etc and whether there is enough compute that can be 
made available for it to apply this algorithmic complexity, and in the event 
that it resorts to approximation to alleviate its lack of resources, for 
example, by employing or coming up with algorithms like the aforementioned 
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm above, then how capable is that of replacing 
human intuition and thought which is already primed for understanding these 
structures as they are without having to reduce them to gain an understanding 
of them?

Reductio ad absurdum (reduction to absurdity) is a favorite thought 
exercise of mine to arrive at such conclusions. When people say AI will 
'replace' us, it is a good idea to fast forward to the future, and I'm talking
thousands or perhaps millions of years, to realize how far we'll still be 
behind our aspirations even with AI's assistance. Consider these examples:

• Type 1 civilization -a
civilization capable of harnessing planetary energy- on the
[Kardashev Scale](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale
){target="_blank"}: we'll need large-scale manufacturing on a level not seen
before, which might be possible only through robot and AI utilization, in what
is known as automation.

• A super suit you wear all day that cleans you and itself and attaches a
highly effective bandaid to your wounds/burns that heals them instantly,
which also happens to have a built in heater and cooler: we'll need huge leaps
in fiber-, bio-, tissue-, mechanical- and other engineering fields to get our 
super suit which might only be possible with careful study and experimentation
heavily aided by computation.

• Flying cars: We'll need safety measures for the flying cars, possibly
achieved with the help of AI but not depending on it, as you wouldn't rely 
on '[vibe coding](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding
){target="_blank"}
' for people's safety. Those safety measures could be a natural progression
from ones created to protect us from drones.

You get the point. For all of that and else, we'll need code.

#### Individual Idiosyncrasy

Another closely related topic to the complexity of the world, is the
complexity of our brains, which are fundamentally different from computers
in how they make sense of and experience things, namely their qualia.

Take something like optical illusions for example. To a computer, images and 
videos that we consider to be [trippy](
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EZCQnfePaVM
){target="_blank"} or [creepy](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PQ0ockV5Q4
){target="_blank"} are a bunch of pixels that are stationary and fixed in 
place.

This means that while all processing units in every computer throughout the
world will process the image exactly the same way given the same algorithm,
human eyes will see it differently. Not only that, but it might be the case 
that every single human views it in a way unique from all others [^3], meaning 
that an image can be seen one way by a computer algorithm, but more than eight 
billion different ways by humans. This discrepancy in perspective should in 
theory entail differences in insight and how humans arrive at conclusions even 
compared to an artificial super-intelligence, and the main way to hone this
perspective is by making sure it can derive insight from a knowledge base, one
which preferably includes coding and all that comes with learning it.

[^3]: [Is Your Red the Same as My Red - VSauce](

){target="_blank"}

Someone might make a case for something like least significant bit (LSB)
[steganography](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography
)
being a way for AI to understand how optical illusions work in our brains, but
that is a totally separate thing from what I'm arguing for here. A machine 
learning model can examine sheet music, or listen to a video that teaches you 
how to do a handstand, and try to replicate both in a different improvised 
style of its own, but it will never get to experience the timbre of the 
instruments that'll play the music the way a human will, nor will it struggle 
with controlling its body with micro adjustments to achieve a physical feat. 
Similarly, it can only be taught the characteristics of an image that causes 
an optical illusion, but it will never get to be the first one to experience 
a new one, and will have to wait for us to put into words what that set of 
pixels/text/soundwaves feels to us.

Its experience will keep being brought closer to ours, for example, using
reinforcement learning to train a robot to backflip correctly, but it won't
learn from it the way a human learning the same feat will, for example, by
controlling his racing thoughts from a problem he had and clearing his mind
up to focus on the task at hand.

#### Binary in the Bin

In the event that mid and high level programming languages fade out of view 
like low level ones did, such as assembly and machine code, and Nvidia's CEO 
Jensen Huang's vision of a coder-less future where anyone can prompt engineer 
their way into fully understanding and applying what needs to be done for 
their upcoming task is realized [^4], then there would still be benefits for having learnt 
how to code.

Who Will Shape the Future of AI? - World Governments Summit](

){target="_blank"}

One group that was seemingly being threatened by AI were musicians and
composers. Multiple instances were popping up of AI composing in the style of
Bach, or completing Beethoven's unfinished 10th Symphony. Even if composers
were left obsolete by AI's recently acquired musical taste, the fact remains
that the **benefits** of learning music will not be taken away by AI. Musicians 
who started learning music at a young age have a larger corpus callosum in the
brain than their non-musician counterparts [^5]. There are also things we can't 
quantitatively measure, such as the mental impact a life full of music had on
their persona.

){target="_blank"}

The same is true, and perhaps even more true, for code. It is a highly
transferable skill given that we deal with logic, text, maths..etc nearly
all-day, everyday. Making your code more neat, coming up with your own 
solution to problems, having your 'Aha!' moment after struggling with a 
software architecture problem are all things that shape who you are, develop 
your analytical thinking and problem solving, and impact how you see a 
potential post-AI, code-less world [^6] [^7].

#### Full on Automation

Threat to coding aside, numerous other professions (collar-agnostic) have felt
the heat from AI, with nearly everyone outside of sports claiming they could 
be replaced by it at one point or another. This is especially true when you 
see how widespread robots have become in all facets of life.

Assuming that will be our future, then manipulating these robots and their
software which will mostly be based on AI might be the job of the future.
Specialists in each field will be required to 'know their way' within code to
survive the upcoming replacement. This has been true for a while for lots of
professions. A mechanical engineer has to learn how to utilize SolidWorks for
his mechanical designs, an architect Revit, and an artist Blender.

In my own profession of medical laboratory sciences, a lab technician was
expected to take a blood sample, make a blood smear out of it, sit on the
microscope for hours to perform a blood count which requires tens of minutes 
per sample, all now replaced by complete blood count (CBC) systems that can
quantify multiple samples with higher accuracy simultaneously.

Microbiological identification and susceptibility testing required plating the 
bacteria and adding antibiotics to it on a Petri dish and waiting for no less 
than a day for results to come out, now all done with a VITEK automated system
that can reduce turnaround times to mere hours.

Point is, what can be done within a field expands over time, and so do the
tools required to navigate that field. There are two choices in front of
people working within those fields: either watch by and use their equivalent 
of a pencil for drawing a blueprint, which is what they've always known, or 
ride the wave and begin utilizing whatever is most suitable to achieve the task
at hand.

#### Stopping Skynet

I must address the most grim of possibilities, which is that of a
[technological singularity](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity
){target="_blank"}, an artificial intelligence that becomes destructive, 
reckless or develops revulsion to humans, in the spirit of exploring the other 
side of absurdity from my reductio ad absurdum argument earlier.

Here we have to ask one question: if AI ends up becoming our worst invention
yet, and ends up causing lots of damage, what would the character and the
knowledge of the person/group who brought it back to its senses or stopped it 
look like? What type of arguments will be needed to communicate with it? I'd
wager that deep understanding of the mathematical models underpinning it and
the code it bases its decisions upon including any hard boundaries will be
attributes of this person/group.

Better yet, what knowledge would AI ethicists need to prevent such an AI from
ever becoming a reality? Again, I think the answer is people with the
attributes above.

## Analysis paralysis

The goal of this post was to mainly highlight how difficult a decision can be
to make, whether it's learning to code or otherwise, when the course of action
can be so non-controversial within the scope of two opposing worldviews.

Utilize mental models of systems and argumentation tools alongside examining
patterns from history that can be insightful as to what position you're 
currently in, and you're more than likely to make a reasonable decision.

## Taking the Next Step

Lessons from this post can be expanded to anything you're thinking about
learning. The same rules apply: it might or might not be useful, but if it's
ubiquitous, mainstream, insightful, transferable and workable, then don't
stress too much about wasting time on it.
